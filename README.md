# Toock - a tock mock

This Toock app was created with React and Firebase, from ground up by myself alone. It is a mock for Tock, a restaurant-booking app that I really liked. This project took me quite some time and hardworks to finish. I overcame some challenges and learnt a lot too.

#### Firebase Hosting Live: https://toock-32270.firebaseapp.com

## Features
- Searching for available time slots for a specific restaurant or cuisine.
- Restaurant has its own page, also the ability to search for a time slot on the page.
- Book the slot with only username and email when not logged in.
- Sign up and log in with email and password.
- Sign up and log in with Google.
- Forgot password feature where a password reset email will be sent.
- Once logged in, booking the slot no longer requires inputting username and email.
- A nice profile page where you can see your upcoming, past and cancelled reservations.
- Cancel a reservation on profile page.
